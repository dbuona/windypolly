	N2 = {Understanding the dynamics of forest structure aids inference regarding future forests and their distributions around the world. Over the last few decades, several papers have addressed changing forest structure in the Sierra Nevada, CA, USA, but these studies were limited in scope. We carried out a broad comparison of forest density and composition in the 1930s versus the 2000s for the west slope of the central and northern Sierra Nevada, using the two most extensive data sets available. Forests in this region have endured a long, complex history of human disturbance, and are now experiencing climatic shifts. We subdivided the landscape into elevation and latitude zones and compared historical and modern tree densities within each zone. We compared densities in historical plots to burned and unburned modern plots, as well as densities of individual tree species in historical vs. modern plots for their entire elevational distribution. Density of small trees (10.2?30.4 cm dbh) was significantly higher in the modern data set for all elevations and all latitudes, ranging from 20 to 148{\%} higher. However, density of large trees (≥61.0 cm) was lower in the modern data set for most elevations and latitudes, ranging from 41{\%} to 60{\%} lower in most zones. Density difference of mid-sized trees (30.5?60.9 cm) was mixed, but was generally higher in modern plots. The pattern of more small trees but fewer large trees held for most individual species as well, but with notable exceptions. Our comparison of burned and unburned plots strongly implicates fire suppression as a driver of increased density of small trees in low- to mid-elevation forests. However, modern high-elevation (>2500 m) forests, where fire suppression impacts should be minimal, were also significantly denser than historical plots. Changing climatic conditions may be driving increased densities of small trees in high elevations, as well as decreased densities of large trees across the region.},

	Abstract = {{Changes in land-use patterns are a major driver of global environmental
   change. Cessation of traditional land-use practices has led to forest
   expansion and shifts in forest composition. Consequently, former
   monospecific forests maintained by traditional management are
   progressing towards mixed forests. However, knowledge is scarce on how
   the presence of other tree species will affect reproduction of formerly
   dominant species. We explored this question in the wind-pollinated tree
   Juniperus thurifera. We hypothesised that the presence of heterospecific
   trees would have a negative effect on cone production and on the
   proportion of cones attacked by specialised predators. We assessed the
   relative importance of forest composition on cone production, seed
   development and pre-dispersal cone damage on nine paired pure and mixed
   J.thurifera forests in three regions across the Iberian Peninsula. The
   effects of forest composition on crop size, cone and seed
   characteristics, as well as damage by pre-dispersal arthropods were
   tested using mixed models. Cone production was lower and seed abortion
   higher in mixed forests, suggesting higher pollination failure. In
   contrast, cone damage by arthropods was higher in pure forests,
   supporting the hypothesis that presence of non-host plants reduces
   damage rates. However, the response of each arthropod to forest
   composition was species-specific and the relative rates of cone damage
   varied depending on individual tree crops. Larger crop sizes in pure
   forests compensated for the higher cone damage rates, leading to a
   higher net production of sound seeds compared to mixed forests. This
   study indicates that ongoing changes in forest composition after land
   abandonment may impact tree reproduction.}},

The observed stimulations of pollen production from the pre- industrial {$[$}CO2{$]$} were due to an increase in the number (at 370 mu mol mol(-1)) and number and size (at 600 mu mol mol(-1)) of floral spikes. Overall, floral weight as a percentage of total plant weight decreased (from 21{\%} to 13{\%}), while investment in pollen increased (from 3.6 to 6{\%}) between 280 and 600 mu mol mol(-1) CO2.

@article{Whitehead1969,
	Abstract = {Studies of the aerodynamics of particle transport and capture suggest that the conditions most propitious for effective wind pollination are as follows: (1) production and release of large numbers of grains; (2) both anthers and stigma exposed; (3) grains falling within a certain size range (20-40\&{\#}x3bc;); very small grains will be dispersed readily but cannot be captured efficiently by the stigma, large grains have a high terminal velocity, hence will settle too rapidly; (4) exine of grains thin (or with large air spaces), sculpture smooth; (5) the stigma should present much surface area to capture grains, but, since collection efficiency will decrease with increasing stigma diameter, the increase in surface should be accomplished through the evolution of a complex stigma with many branches of small diameter; (6) individuals of the species should not be too widely spaced in the vegetation; (7) the vegetation should be open in structure or deciduous; thus there will be few obstructions to transport during at least one portion of the year; (8) flowering must be closely coordinated by relatively unambiguous environmental stimuli; (9) pollen release (hence flowering) should coincide with the most favorable time of the year for transport (low probability of precipitation, adequate winds and turbulence, deciduous season). The geography of wind pollination in the angiosperms can be understood best in terms of these prerequisites for efficient transport of pollen. Anemophily is very infrequent in the tropical rain forest, becomes more frequent as one moves to more seasonally variable environments, and is frequent in northern temperate forests. The environment of the tropical rain forest is unsuitable for anemophily: (1) species diversity is very high, hence individuals of the same species are apt to be widely spaced; (2) the forest is densely structured, hence wind velocities are low and there are many obstacles to transport; (3) there is no leafless season; (4) rainfall is frequent throughout the year, hence transport will be limited; (5) there are few unambiguous stimuli which can coordinate flowering; (6) potential animal pollinators are abundant. These conditions do not exist in northern temperate forests, or in prairies, or in savannas. It is possible that the evolution of wind pollination in the angiosperms paralleled the evolution of the deciduous habit. Axelrod has suggested that the deciduous habit evolved in response to seasonal drought as angiosperms migrated into lower middle latitudes during the early Cretaceous. Both the deciduous habit and the physical conditions existing just peripheral to the tropics would favor the evolution of wind pollination. An examination of seasonal environments in the tropics at present and the fossil record of deciduous and wind pollinated angiosperms supports this contention.},

	Abstract = {A number of morphologic features have evolved in evolutionarily divergent plant groups that appear to increase the efficiency of wind pollination. Among these features are the appearance of low density pollen grains, female ovulate organs that direct air currents carrying pollen toward stigmas or micropyles, and population structures with a high density of con-specifics. This paper reviews the aerodynamic theory, and the experimental and field data that are relevant to an understanding of the adaptive significance of these and other features of anemophily. Emphasis is placed on the mathematical description of the behavior of airflow patterns around ovulate organs. The efficiency of wind pollination is shown to be dictated principally by the vectoral properties of air currents created by and around ovulate organs and the physical properties of pollen that dictate their behavior as airborne particles. /// Eine Anzahl von morphologischen Kennzeichen, die Effizienz der Windpollination zu steigern scheinen, haben sich in evolution\&{\#}xe4;r ausenandergehonden Pflanzengruppen entwickelt.

	Abstract = {{The effect of non-reproductive trees and saplings as a physical barrier
   to pollen dispersal in wind-pollinated species' forests has not received
   enough attention in the literature so far. The neighborhood seedling
   model was used to fit pollen dispersal models for beech at different
   stages of gap recolonization and to elucidate the effect of saplings as
   a physical barrier on pollen dispersal at local scale. Phenological
   overlap of leaf emergence, and pollen release as well as wind
   directionality patterns were also examined. As a case study, we used a
   mixed beech-oak forest that was managed as open woodland until 1974. The
   ban on entry of cattle has led to the recolonization of empty spaces by
   seedlings and saplings of beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and two oak species
   (Quercus petraea (Matts.) Liebl. and Q. pyrenaica Willd.) and, at last,
   to canopy closure. The average pollen dispersal distance for the first
   plants that regenerated in the gaps was almost twice those found for
   recently installed seedlings and seeds collected in traps, supporting
   the hypothesis that the understory may act as a physical barrier to
   pollen dispersal. Although a substantial part of effective pollination
   directionality is at random, horizontal winds and vertical anabatic
   winds may explain some of this directionality. At the time of beech
   pollen release, leaves of beech and sessile oak are fully developed,
   enhancing pollen interception by the saplings. Explicit models of pollen
   dispersal for wind-pollinated trees should incorporate the effect of
   canopy closure caused by growth of saplings and account for leaf
   phenology of co-occurring species in the forest.}},

@article{Nathan2005,
	Abstract = {{Seed terminal velocity and release height are recognized as key biotic
   determinants of long-distance dispersal (LDD) of seeds by wind. Yet,
   potential determinants at the ecosystem level, such as seasonal dynamics
   in foliage density characterizing many deciduous forests, have received
   much less attention. We integrated detailed field observations and
   experiments with a mechanistic wind dispersal model to assess how
   seasonal variation in foliage density, estimated by leaf-area index
   (LAI), affects LDD in deciduous forests. We found that the model,
   previously shown to accurately predict seed dispersal by wind, also
   reliably describes the effects of LAI variation on wind statistics for a
   wide range of canopy types. Sparser canopies are characterized by more
   organized vertical eddy motion that promotes LDD by uplifting seeds to
   higher elevations where winds are stronger. Yet, sparser canopies are
   also characterized by reduced mean windspeed aloft. We showed that
   former effect more than compensates for the latter, i.e., conditions of
   low LAI are favorable for LDD. This may account for the tendency of many
   temperate tree species to restrict seed release to either early spring
   or late fall, when LAI is relatively low. Sensitivity analysis reveals
   that the typical seasonal variation in LAI can be more important to LDD
   of seeds by wind than the natural variation in seed terminal velocity.
   Because our model accurately describes the effects of LAI variation for
   distinctly different sites, species, and life forms, we suggest that its
   results reflect a general association between LDD and foliage density
   dynamics.}},

@article{Fernandez-Martinez:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Quercus species exhibit an extreme inter-annual variability in seed production often synchronized over large geographical areas (masting). Since this reproductive behavior is mostly observed in anemophilous plants, pollination efficiency is suggested as one hypothesis to explain it, although resource-based hypotheses are also suggested as alternatives. We analyzed the effect of flowering phenology, airborne pollen presence and meteorological conditions in the pattern of acorn production in mixed evergreen-deciduous oak forests (Quercus ilex and Quercus pubescens) in NE Spain for twelve years (1998--2009). In both oaks, higher temperatures advanced the onset of flowering and increased the amount of airborne pollen. Nevertheless, inter-annual differences in pollen production did not influence acorn crop size. Acorn production was enhanced by a delay in flowering onset in Q. ilex but not in Q. pubescens. This suggests that in perennial oaks a larger number of photosynthates produced before flowering could benefit reproduction while the lack of effects on deciduous oaks could be because these species flush new leaves and flowers at the same time. Notwithstanding this effect, spring water deficit was the most relevant factor in explaining inter-annual variability in acorn production in both species. Considering that future climate scenarios predict progressive warmer and dryer spring seasons in the Mediterranean Basin, this might result in earlier onsets of flowering and higher water deficits that would constrain acorn production.},

@article{Ackerman:2000aa,
	Abstract = {{$[$}The transport and capture of pollen in ∼20{\%} of all angiosperm families occurs in air and water. In other words, pollination is abiotic and occurs via the fluid media, not an animal vector. Whereas some early concepts considered abiotic pollination to be largely a stochastic phenomenon, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that wind pollination (i.e. anemophily) and water pollination (i.e. hydrophily) have deterministic features and are sophisticated fluid dynamic solutions to the problem of pollen release, dispersal, and capture. An abiotic pollination syndrome is defined in which there is spatial or temporal separation of carpellate and staminate flowers, which are drab, a reduction in perianth parts, stigmas and anthers are exposed to the fluid, and typically unclumped pollen may be produced in large amounts. Separate pollination syndromes are defined for anemophilous (i.e. wind-pollinated), ephydrophilous (i.e. surface-pollinated), and hydrophilous (i.e. submarine-pollinated) plants. Distinctions are based on habitat and physical conditions for pollination, pollen size, shape, and ultrastructure, morphology and ultrastructure of stigmas, and outcrossing rates. For example, anemophilous pollen are spherical and small, ephydrophilous pollen are spherical or reniform and large, while hydrophilous pollen are filiform (i.e. filamentous) or funcionally filiform. The pollination mechanisms and mechanics associated with these syndromes reveals a strong evolutionary relationship between plant morphology and fluid dynamics.{$]$}},

	N2 = {It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67{\%} to 96{\%} but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78{\%} in temperate-zone communities to 94{\%} in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5{\%} of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant?pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems.},

We found degradation of interaction network structure and function and extirpation of 50% of bee species. Network changes can be attributed to shifts in forb and bee phenologies resulting in temporal mismatches, nonrandom species extinctions, and loss of spatial co-occurrences between extant species in modified landscapes. Quantity and quality of pollination services have declined through time. The historic network showed flexibility in response to disturbance; however, our data suggest that networks will be less resilient to future changes.},

@article{Dietzsch:2011aa,
	Abstract = {{$[$}One major characteristic of invasive alien species is their occurrence at high abundances in their new habitat. Flowering invasive plant species that are visited by native insects and overlap with native plant species in their pollinators may facilitate or disrupt native flower visitation and fertilisation by forming large, dense populations with high numbers of flowers and copious rewards. We investigated the direction of such a proposed effect for the alien invasive Rhododendron ponticum in Irish habitats. Flower visitation, conspecific and alien pollen deposition, fruit and seed set were measured in a self-compatible native focal plant, Digitalis purpurea, and compared between field sites that contained different relative abundances of R. ponticum. Flower visitation was significantly lower at higher alien relative plant abundances than at lower abundances or in the absence of the alien. Native flowers experienced a significant decrease in conspecific pollen deposition with increasing alien abundance. Heterospecific pollen transfer was very low in all field sites but increased significantly with increasing relative R. ponticum abundance. However, lower flower visitation and lower conspecific pollen transfer did not alter reproductive success of D. purpurea. Our study shows that indirect interactions between alien and native plants for pollination can be modified by population characteristics (such as relative abundance) in a similar way as interactions among native plant species. In D. purpurea, only certain aspects of pollination and reproduction were affected by high alien abundances which is probably a result of high resilience due to a self-compatible breeding system. Native species that are more susceptible to pollen limitation are more likely to experience fitness disadvantages in habitats with high relative alien plant abundances.{$]$}},

	Abstract = {Mast-seeding is the synchronous production of large seed crops within a population or community of species every two or more years. This paper addresses three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses explaining the evolution of mast-seeding in temperate tree species, especially the genus Quercus: (1) mast-seeding is a consequence of mast-flowering which evolves to increased pollination efficiency in mast-flowering years; (2) mast-seeding has evolved as an anti-predator adaptation by which large seed crops during mast years satiate the seed predators and allow survival of some of the seeds; (3) selection on seed size by habitat can indirectly affect the evolution of masting if trees with large seeds require more time to accumulate reserves to mature those seeds. I find support for the pollination hypothesis in several wind-pollinated temperate tree species but not oaks. However, oaks show evidence favoring the predation and seed size hypotheses. I then develop a model to illustrate the relationships among the three hypotheses in their effects on the evolution of masting. Finally, using data from herbaria and Floras, the influence of selection via flowering, fruiting, and seed size in the evolution of masting in tropical oaks is discussed. I conclude that the need for a supra-annual cue to synchronize flowering and fruiting as well as the larger seed size found in many tropical oak species should contribute to the evolution of masting to a greater extent than seen among temperate oaks.},

Here, we explore how masting is affected by plant resource budgets, fruit maturation success, and hormonal coordination of cues including weather and resources. There is little empirical support for the commonly stated hypothesis that plants store carbohydrates over several years to expend in a high-seed year. Plants can switch carbohydrates away from growth in high-seed years, and seed crops are more probably limited by nitrogen or phosphorus. Resources are clearly involved in the proximate mechanisms driving masting, but resource budget (RB) models cannot create masting in the absence of selection because some underlying selective benefit is required to set the level of a `full'seed crop at greater than the annual resource increment.

We examined floral morphological and developmental traits across an entire SC MM genus, Collinsia, to determine which, if any, predict potential autonomous selfing ability when pollinators are absent (AS) and actual selfing rates in the wild, sm, and to best define the selfing syndrome for this clade.Using polymorphic microsatellite markers, we obtained 30 population-level estimates of sm across 19 Collinsia taxa. Species grand means for the timing of herkogamy (stigma--anther contact) and dichogamy (stigmatic receptivity, SR), AS, floral size, longevity and their genetic correlations were quantified for 22 taxa.Species fell into discrete selfing and outcrossing groups based on floral traits. Loss of dichogamy defines Collinsia's selfing syndrome. Floral size, longevity and herkogamy also differ significantly between these groups. Most taxa have high AS rates ({$>$}80 {\%}), but AS is uncorrelated with any measured trait. In contrast, sm is significantly correlated only with SR. High variance in sm was observed in the two groups.Collinsia species exhibit clear morphological and developmental traits diagnostic of `selfing'or `outcrossing'groups. However, many species in both the `selfing'and the `outcrossing'groups were MM, pointing to the critical influence of the pollination environment, the timing of AS and outcross pollen prepotency on sm. Flower size is a poor predictor of Collinsia species' field selfing rates and this result may apply to many SC species. Assessment of the variation in the pollination environment, which can increase selfing rates in more `outcrossing'species but can also decrease selfing rates in more `selfing'species, is critical to understanding mating system evolution of SC MM taxa.},

	N2 = {Premise of the Study The evolution of multiple floral traits often underlies the transition from outcrossing to selfing. Such traits can influence the ability to self, and the timing at which selfing occurs, which in turn affects the costs of selfing. Species that display variation in autonomous selfing provide an opportunity to dissect the phenotypic changes that contribute to variability in the mating system. Methods In a common garden, we measured dichogamy and herkogamy in 24 populations of the protandrous mixed-mating herb Campanula americana, and related these to autonomous fruit set (autonomy). We then measured the timing of self-pollen deposition and fruit production in populations with high and low autonomy, and determined whether pollen germinability across floral development contributes to variation in autonomy. Key Results Populations that transitioned more rapidly to female phase displayed elevated autonomous selfing, but herkogamy was unassociated with autonomous selfing. Selfing occurred more rapidly in highly autonomous populations because of greater self-pollen deposition early in female phase. Pollen germinability in low-autonomy populations remained constant across floral development, but in high-autonomy populations it increased after floral anthesis and was highest near the onset of female phase. Conclusions Reduced dichogamy, elevated self-pollen deposition, and higher pollen germination late in male phase contribute to both earlier selfing and greater selfing. These traits vary among populations, likely reflecting past selection on the mating system. While delayed selfing bears fewer fitness costs, the evolution of earlier selfing may be favored if self-pollen availability decreases over floral development.},

The most important technological breakthrough was the introduction of microsatellite markers to molecular ecology, an advance that was accompanied by a proliferation and refinement of statistical techniques for the analysis of parentage data. Over the last several years, we have seen steady progress in a number of areas related to parentage analysis, and the prospects for successful studies continue to improve. Here, we provide an updated guide for scientists interested in embarking on parentage analysis in natural or artificial populations of organisms, with a particular focus on computer software packages that implement various methods of analysis. Our survey of the literature shows that there are a few established methods that perform extremely well in the analysis of most types of parentage studies. However, particular experimental designs or study systems can benefit from some of the less well-known computer packages available. Overall, we find that parentage analysis is feasible and satisfying in most systems, and we try to provide a simple roadmap to help other scientists navigate the confusing topography of statistical techniques.},

In outcrossing species, there is almost invariably a clash between selection to place pollen and stigmas in similar positions for effective pollination and selection to keep the androecia and gynoecia apart to avoid interference between them. We suggest that the separation of pollen and stigmas acts in general to reduce this self-interference and it often also reduces self-fertilisation. Mechanisms preventing self-fertilisation primarily increase maternal fitness, whereas mechanisms avoiding self-interference primarily promote paternal fitness.

Therefore, a study on floral morphology, pollen production, germination and pollen dispersal in M. esculenta was undertaken in a Himalayan temperate forest during 2015--2016 for one reproductive season. Pollen production and dispersion were observed in two habitat conditions, viz. tree outside forest (TOF) and natural forest (NF). Pollen flow was observed by exposing jelly-coated slides at geometrically increasing distances under two habitat conditions, i.e. TOF and NF. The pollen production per tree was significantly higher in TOF conditions (two times more than the NF). The total pollen production in the trees of outside forest was 3.10 ×1011 $\pm$0.58 ×1011 pollen per tree which was 1.60 ×1011 $\pm$0.42 ×1011 pollen per tree in natural forest condition. The fruit set was 6{\%} more in TOF condition than the NF, indicating pollen limitation fecundity in M. esculenta. Pollen dispersal strongly differed between TOF and NF.},

Resource dynamics, pollination success, and, as described here, environmental veto are possible proximate mechanisms driving masting. We explored the environmental veto hypothesis, which assumes that reproductive synchrony is driven by external factors preventing reproduction in some years, by extending the resource budget model of masting with correlated reproductive failure. We ran this model across its parameter space to explore how key parameters interact to drive seeding dynamics. Next, we parameterized the model based on 16 yr of seed production data for populations of red (Quercus rubra) and white (Quercus alba) oaks. We used these empirical models to simulate seeding dynamics, and compared simulated time series with patterns observed in the field. Simulations showed that resource dynamics and reproduction failure can produce masting even in the absence of pollen coupling. In concordance with this, in both oaks, among-year variation in resource gain and correlated reproductive failure were necessary and sufficient to reproduce masting, whereas pollen coupling, although present, was not necessary. Reproductive failure caused by environmental veto may drive large-scale synchronization without density-dependent pollen limitation. Reproduction-inhibiting weather events are prevalent in ecosystems, making described mechanisms likely to operate in many systems.},

In this study, we first analyze a long-term data set on reproductive and vegetative growth of Quercus ilex in a mediterranean woodland in order to identify the main environmental drivers of interannual variation in flower and seed production and contrast the impact of climate vs. adaptive factors as main causes of masting. Second, we conducted an experiment of rainfall exclusion to evaluate the effects of an increasing drought (simulating predictions of global change models) on both reproductive processes. The annual seed crop was always affected by environmental factors related to the precipitation pattern, these abiotic factors disrupting the fruiting process at different periods of time. Seed production was strongly dependent upon water availability for the plant at initial (spring) and advanced (summer) stages of the acorn maturation cycle, whereas the final step of seed development was negatively affected by the frequency of torrential-rain events. We also found clear evidence that seed masting in the study species is not only regulated by selective endogenous rhythms, but is mainly a physiological response to the variable environment. Our results from the rainfall exclusion experiment corroborated the conclusions obtained from the 26-year fruiting record and demonstrated that the high interannual variation in seed crop was mainly determined by the success in seed development rather than by the flowering effort. Under a global change scenario, it could be expected that the drier conditions predicted by climate models reinforce the negative effects of summer drought on seed production, leading to negative consequences for tree recruitment and forest dynamics.},

To address this question, we compiled a dataset for phylogenetic comparative analysis of long-term fruit/seed production for plants comprising 920 time series spanning 311 plant species. Factors associated with both adaptive benefits of CVp (wind pollination and seed dispersal) and climatic variability (variability of summer precipitation) were among the best predictors of global variation in CVp. We observed a hump-shaped relationship between CVp and latitude and intermediate phylogenetic and geographic signals in CVp. CVp is patterned nonrandomly across the globe and over the plant tree of life, where high CVp is associated with species benefiting from economies of scale of seed or flower production and with species that experience variable rainfall over summer months when seeds usually mature.},

Our mechanistic model explained 90?99{\%} of the variation in Chionochloa flowering, with higher rates of stored resource mobilisation and lower probability of climatic induction of flowering occurring at lower fertility sites. Inter-annual variation in floral induction and the degree to which seeding is resource-limited explained shifts in the relative performance of different empirical models fitted to data simulated from the mechanistic model. Empirical models explicitly capturing the interaction between the floral induction cue and internal resource state underlying the resource-limited induction mechanism had > 8.7? the statistical support of alternatives when fitted to Chionochloa datasets.

	N2 = {Summary Many perennial plants display masting, that is, fruiting with strong interannual variations, irregular and synchronized between trees within the population. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the early flower phenology in temperate oak species promotes stochasticity into their fruiting dynamics, which could play a major role in tree reproductive success. From a large field monitoring network, we compared the pollen phenology between temperate and Mediterranean oak species. Then, focusing on temperate oak species, we explored the influence of the weather around the time of budburst and flowering on seed production, and simulated with a mechanistic model the consequences that an evolutionary shifting of flower phenology would have on fruiting dynamics. Temperate oak species release pollen earlier in the season than do Mediterranean oak species. Such early flowering in temperate oak species results in pollen often being released during unfavorable weather conditions and frequently results in reproductive failure. If pollen release were delayed as a result of natural selection, fruiting dynamics would exhibit much reduced stochastic variation. We propose that early flower phenology might be adaptive by making mast-seeding years rare and unpredictable, which would greatly help in controlling the dynamics of seed consumers.},

   in the next century, with potentially large but poorly understood
   impacts on ecological interactions. Here we propose potential effects of
   increased temperatures on ecologically dominant New Zealand grasses

   data from five masting Chionochloa species in New Zealand showed that
   the cue for heavy flowering was unusually high temperature in the summer
   of the year before flowering. Attack by predispersal insect seed
   predators was much reduced in mast years, apparently because predator
   populations were satiated. Increased temperatures would greatly decrease
   interannual variation in Chionochloa flowering, allowing seed predator
   populations to increase and potentially to devastate the seed crop
   annually. Similar responses are likely in masting species worldwide.

	Abstract = {{Decadal changes in masting behaviour-directional changes in seed
   production with fluctuations on a decadal time-scale-are attracting
   widespread attention in the context of global climate change. However,
   our mechanistic understanding of the effects of climate on seed
   production on a decadal scale is unsatisfactory, partly because of the
   insufficient statistical analyses of long-term data on masting.
   We detected decadal changes in masting behaviour in the Japanese oak
   Quercus crispula based on long-term data (38 years: 1980-2017) from the
   Kitakami Mountains of Japan. The moving average of seed production in a
   20-year sliding window increased, whereas the coefficient of variation
   decreased. A wavelet power spectrum, as well as a second-order
   log-linear autoregressive (AR) model showed that masting intervals
   shortened from 3- or 4-year cycle to a 2-year cycle.
   The moving average of seed production increased linearly as the moving
   average of temperature increased. Temporal variations of the two AR
   model coefficients as a function of temperature were well described by
   concave curves.
   Synthesis. By conducting the statistical analyses of a long-term seed
   production dataset, we obtained significant evidence of decadal changes
   in the masting behaviour of the Japanese oak and showed that the
   shortening of the masting interval was associated with rising
   temperature. A resource allocation shift and an environmental veto were
   discussed as possible mechanisms underlying the decadal change.}},

We studied masting in the valley oak (Quercus lobata N{\'e}e), a California endemic tree, and report evidence that phenological synchrony in flowering driven by microclimatic variability determines the size of the acorn crop through its effects on pollen availability and fertilization success. These findings integrate two of the major factors believed to influence seed production in wind-pollinated species?environmental conditions and pollen limitation?by means of a coherent mechanistic hypothesis for how highly variable and synchronized annual seed production is accomplished. We illustrate how, by means of a simulation based on the mechanism proposed here, climate change may influence masting patterns through its effects on environmental variability.},

Several hypotheses make predictions about the effect of weather on annual pollination success. The pollen coupling hypothesis predicts that weather and plant resources drive the flowering effort of trees, which directly translates into the size of seed crops through efficient pollination. In contrast, the pollination Moran effect hypothesis predicts that weather affects pollination efficiency, leading to occasional bumper crops. Furthermore, the recently formulated phenology synchrony hypothesis predicts that Moran effects can arise because of weather effects on flowering synchrony, which, in turn, drives pollination efficiency.

	Abstract = {Human activities are fragmenting forests and woodlands worldwide, but the impact of reduced tree population densities on pollen transfer in wind-pollinated trees is poorly understood. In a 4-year study, we evaluated relationships among stand density, pollen availability, and seed production in a thinned and fragmented population of blue oak (Quercus douglasii). Geographic coordinates were established and flowering interval determined for 100 contiguous trees. The number of neighboring trees within 60 m that released pollen during each tree's flowering period was calculated and relationships with acorn production explored using multiple regression. We evaluated the effects of female flower production, average temperature, and relative humidity during the pollination period, and number of pollen-producing neighbors on individual trees' acorn production. All factors except temperature were significant in at least one of the years of our study, but the combination of factors influencing acorn production varied among years. In 1996, a year of large acorn crop size, acorn production was significantly positively associated with number of neighboring pollen producers and density of female flowers. In 1997, 1998, and 1999, many trees produced few or no acorns, and significant associations between number of pollen-producing neighbors and acorn production were only apparent among moderately to highly reproductive trees. Acorn production by these reproductive trees in 1997 was significantly positively associated with number of neighboring pollen producers and significantly negatively associated with average relative humidity during the pollination period. In 1998, no analysis was possible, because too few trees produced a moderate to large acorn crop. Only density of female flowers was significantly associated with acorn production of moderately to highly reproductive trees in 1999. The effect of spatial scale was also investigated by conducting analyses with pollen producers counted in radii ranging from 30 m to 80 m. The association between number of pollen-producing neighbors and acorn production was strongest when neighborhood sizes of 60 m or larger were considered. Our results suggest that fragmentation and thinning of blue oak woodlands may reduce pollen availability and limit reproduction in this wind-pollinated species.},

We argue that population genetics theory may be misapplied in light of ecological realities that, when recognized, require scrutiny of underlying evolutionary assumptions. One ecological reality is that fragment boundaries often do not represent boundaries for mating populations of trees that benefit from long-distance pollination, sometimes abetted by long-distance seed dispersal. Where fragments do not delineate populations, genetic theory of small populations does not apply. Even in spatially isolated populations, where genetic theory may eventually apply, evolutionary arguments assume that samples from fragmented populations represent trees that have had sufficient time to experience drift, inbreeding, and ultimately inbreeding depression, an unwarranted assumption where stands in fragments are living relicts of largely unrelated predisturbance populations. Genetic degradation may not be as important as ecological degradation for many decades following habitat fragmentation.},

	Abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is one of the most important causes for the decline of plant species. However, plants differing in phylogeny, habitat requirements and biology are likely to respond differently to habitat fragmentation. We ask whether case studies on the effects of habitat fragmentation conducted so far allow generalizations about its effects on the fitness and genetic diversity of populations of endangered plant species. We compared the characteristics of plant species endangered in Germany whose sensitivity to habitat fragmentation had been studied with those of the endangered species that had not been studied. We found strong discrepancies between the two groups with regard to their taxonomy and traits relevant to their sensitivity to habitat fragmentation. Monocots, graminoids, clonal, abiotically pollinated and self compatible species were underrepresented among the studied species, and most study species were from a few habitat types, in particular grasslands. We conclude that our current knowledge of the effects of habitat fragmentation on plant populations is not sufficient to provide widely applicable guidelines for species management. The selection of species studied so far has been biased toward species from certain habitats and species exhibiting traits that probably make them vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. Future studies should include community-wide approaches in different habitats, e.g. re-visitation studies in which the species pool is assessed at different time intervals, and population-biological studies of species from a wide range of habitats, and of different life forms and growth strategies. A more representative picture of the effects of habitat fragmentation would allow a better assessment of threats and more specific recommendations for optimally managing populations of endangered plants.},

	N2 = {The evolution of many floral traits, including monoecy and dichogamy, has been attributed to selection for avoidance of self-fertilization. If this explanation is correct, monoecy and dichogamy should be uncommon among self-incompatible species because physiological barriers prevent self-fertilization in such species. In fact, self-fertility was independent of sexual system in a sample of 588 hermaphroditic and monoecious angiosperms. Overall, dichogamy was also equally common among self-incompatible and self-compatible species. When the different forms of dichogamy were analyzed separately, only intrafloral protogyny was associated with self-compatibility. This form of dichogamy is less common among angiosperms than intrafloral protandry, which is probably less effective at reducing self-fertilization. Thus, avoidance of self-fertilization has probably been less important in the evolution of monoecy and most forms of dichogamy than other factors, such as avoidance of pollen-pistil interference, and flexibility of resource allocation to male and female functions.},

	Abstract = {Atmospheric precipitation removes the majority of biological and chemical pollutants from the lower parts of the troposphere. However, some studies infer increasing atmospheric pollen concentrations during precipitation events and/or thunderstorms, which are known to trigger allergic reactions (referred to as thunderstorm-triggered asthma). The aim of this study was to determine the impacts of precipitation on the diurnal variability of airborne pollen concentrations, with particular focus on the timing and intensity of precipitation events. We also considered the impacts of other meteorological elements on atmospheric pollen concentrations. The research was conducted in Rzesz{\'o}w (SE Poland) from 2016 to 2018. We used two aerobiological and two meteorological stations in this study to determine potential spatial variability in the pollen response to rainfall, the diurnal precipitation changes, and the precipitation intensity in the city area. We determined the pollen response of four pollen types: Betula, Pinus, Poaceae, and Urtica, and we only included data from days that fulfilled restrictive criteria throughout all pollen seasons. We analysed a total of 81 days, which were divided into five groups according to precipitation intensity, the time of day of a precipitation event, and the type of pollen response to precipitation. Our results suggest that precipitation intensity was the dominant control on pollen concentrations; concentrations only decreased clearly under rainfall intensities of at least 5 mm*h−1 and this value we recommended as threshold value for long lasting decrease of pollen concentrations in our region. Lower intensity rainfall events resulted in no change in atmospheric pollen concentrations throughout the day. We noted the occurrence of increased pollen concentration immediately before and during rainfall events. Further, other parameters were also found to influence pollen concentrations in the atmosphere, including relative humidity, the time of day, and biological factors such as the plant phenophase or the phase of a pollen season.},

	Abstract = {Many diseases are linked with climate trends and variations. In particular, climate change is expected to alter the spatiotemporal dynamics of allergenic airborne pollen and potentially increase occurrence of allergic airway disease. Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of changes in pollen season timing and levels is thus important in assessing climate impacts on aerobiology and allergy caused by allergenic airborne pollen. Here, we describe the spatiotemporal patterns of changes in the seasonal timing and levels of allergenic airborne pollen for multiple taxa in different climate regions at a continental scale. The allergenic pollen seasons of representative trees, weeds and grass during the past decade (2001-2010) across the contiguous United States have been observed to start 3.0 {$[$}95{\%} Confidence Interval (CI), 1.1-4.9{$]$} days earlier on average than in the 1990s (1994-2000). The average peak value and annual total of daily counted airborne pollen have increased by 42.4{\%} (95{\%} CI, 21.9-62.9{\%}) and 46.0{\%} (95{\%} CI, 21.5-70.5{\%}), respectively. Changes of pollen season timing and airborne levels depend on latitude, and are associated with changes of growing degree days, frost free days, and precipitation. These changes are likely due to recent climate change and particularly the enhanced warming and precipitation at higher latitudes in the contiguous United States.},

However, in temperate and boreal latitudes, temperature is not the only cue used by trees to determine seasonality, as changes in photoperiod provide a more consistent, reliable annual signal of seasonality than temperature. Here, we discuss how day length may limit the ability of tree species to respond to climate warming in situ, focusing on the implications of photoperiodic sensing for extending the growing season and affecting plant phenology and growth, as well as the potential role of photoperiod in controlling carbon uptake and water fluxes in forests. We also review whether there are patterns across plant functional types (based on successional strategy, xylem anatomy and leaf morphology) in their sensitivity to photoperiod that we can use to predict which species or groups might be more successful in migrating as the climate warms, or may be more successfully used for forestry and agriculture through assisted migration schemes.},

The two conditions were represented equally in the population investigated. Synchronization of blooming periods of flowers of opposite sexes resulted in reciprocal pollination between trees with different dichogamous conditions. On protogynous trees a slight overlap in blooming occurred between male and female flowers when air temperatures were near average. The period of overlap became longer when temperatures dropped below average. Conversely, higher than normal temperatures resulted in an increased tendency toward complete dichogamy, primarily because of early desiccation of the stigmas. Abnormally high or low temperatures seemed to exert little effect on the duration of the blooming periods of flowers of either sex on protandrous trees.},

	Abstract = {{Sex allocation in hermaphrodites can be affected by spatial and temporal
   variation in resources, especially in plants where size-dependent gender
   modification is commonplace. The evolution of sex allocation will depend
   on the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors
   governing patterns of investment in female and male function. In
   wind-pollinated plants, theoretical models predict a positive relation
   between size and male investment because of the fitness advantages
   associated with more effective pollen dispersal. Theory also predicts
   that the timing and allocation to each sex function should depend on
   available resources. We grew maternal half-sibling families of annual,
   wind-pollinated, Ambrosia artemisiifolia in sun and shade treatments to
   investigate these predictions. There was significant genetic variation
   for female and male flower production in both sun and shade treatments.
   Size-dependent sex allocation occurred in the direction predicted by
   theory, with male flower production increasing more rapidly in larger
   plants. The timing of sex function also varied, with significant genetic
   variation for dichogamy within environments and plasticity of this trait
   between environments. Protandry was expressed more commonly in the sun
   and protogyny in the shade. The occurrence of dynamic sex allocation
   with changing size and experimental treatment indicates the potential
   for adaptive responses under different ecological conditions.}},

	Abstract = {The mutualism between plants and their pollinators provides globally important ecosystem services, but it is likely to be disrupted by global warming that can cause mismatches between both halves of this interaction. In this review, we summarise the available evidence on (i) spatial or (ii) phenological shifts of one or both of the actors of this mutualism. While the occurrence of future spatial mismatches is predominantly theoretical and based on predictive models, there is growing empirical evidence of phenological mismatches occurring at the present day. Mismatches may also occur when pollinators and their host plants are still found together. These mismatches can arise due to (iii) morphological modifications and (iv) disruptions to host attraction and foraging behaviours, and it is expected that these mismatches will lead to novel community assemblages. Overall plant--pollinator interactions seem to be resilient biological networks, particularly because generalist species can buffer these changes due to their plastic behaviour. However, we currently lack information on where and why spatial mismatches do occur and how they impact the fitness of plants and pollinators, in order to fully assess if adaptive evolutionary changes can keep pace with global warming predictions.},

	N2 = {Abstract Anthropogenic climate change is widely expected to drive species extinct by hampering individual survival and reproduction, by reducing the amount and accessibility of suitable habitat, or by eliminating other organisms that are essential to the species in question. Less well appreciated is the likelihood that climate change will directly disrupt or eliminate mutually beneficial (mutualistic) ecological interactions between species even before extinctions occur. We explored the potential disruption of a ubiquitous mutualistic interaction of terrestrial habitats, that between plants and their animal pollinators, via climate change. We used a highly resolved empirical network of interactions between 1420 pollinator and 429 plant species to simulate consequences of the phenological shifts that can be expected with a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Depending on model assumptions, phenological shifts reduced the floral resources available to 17?50{\%} of all pollinator species, causing as much as half of the ancestral activity period of the animals to fall at times when no food plants were available. Reduced overlap between plants and pollinators also decreased diet breadth of the pollinators. The predicted result of these disruptions is the extinction of pollinators, plants and their crucial interactions.},

	N2 = {Light availability in the understory of deciduous forests changes drastically within the growing season due to the foliage dynamics of canopy trees. Because flowering phenology, photosynthetic characteristics, and fruiting success respond to such strong seasonality in light availability, we hypothesized that understory plants in such ecosystems should describe distinct phenological groups or syndromes where ?syndrome? is defined only as a set of characteristics that co-occur. To identify these phenological syndromes, we studied the flowering phenology, fruit or seed set, and photosynthetic characteristics for 18 perennial understory herbaceous species that differed in reproductive strategy over eight years in a deciduous forest in northern Japan. Three phenological groups emerged from this study: (1) spring bloomers, flowering and fruiting before the completion of canopy closure; (2) early-summer bloomers, flowering during the progress of canopy closure and fruiting after canopy closure; and (3) late-summer bloomers, flowering and fruiting after canopy closure. The spring bloomers had high photosynthetic rates and high fruiting abilities, but the flowering time varied considerably among years due to yearly fluctuations of snowmelt date. Bumble bee-pollinated species of spring bloomers showed variable seed-set success, while fly-pollinated species showed relatively stable seed sets over the years. The early-summer bloomers showed low fruiting abilities irrespective of pollination success, reflecting severe resource limitation with decelerating light availability during fruit development. Although the late-summer bloomers showed low photosynthetic rates under low-light conditions, high fruit-set success was attained if pollination was sufficient. These results support our hypothesis that phenological syndromes may be found in deciduous forest understory plants. Given that reproductive success of bee-pollinated spring bloomers is highly susceptible to seasonal fluctuation, climate change may have its strongest impacts on this group.},

Relating pecan orchard management to the phenological stage of the trees is the key to increasing yields; however, describing morphology alone does not lead to an orchard management system that is simple and practical. In this work, we extend the BBCH (Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und Chemische Industrie) coding method to describe the morphology of the protogynous Mahan pecan cultivar over two consecutive years in southern China. Eight main growth stages, from vegetative bud dormancy to fruit harvest, were described and each phenological period was photographed. Pecan orchard management activities were listed for each stage in pecan BBCH scale to allow orchard managers to better manage their trees. This codification will facilitate breeding, conservation of genetic resources and general orchard management of this commercial crop. As well, recording the dates of various morphological stages over time will allow the influence of global climate change on pecan development to be tracked.},

	Abstract = {{The mating system of Douglas-fir {[}Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)
   Franco] was examined in two genetically similar seed orchard blocks with
   the aid of allozyme polymorphisms at six loci.  The pollination
   environment (time of pollination and length of pollination season) of
   one block was manipulated by means of an overhead water spray cooling
   treatment.  The cooling treatment temporarily delayed the pollination
   season in the treated block by 12 days relative to the untreated one. 
   In addition, the length of the pollination season in the cooled block
   was shorter than the uncooled one by 12 days (18 vs. 30 days).  The rate
   of inbreeding was significant in the uncooled block, while a perfect
   outcrossing rate was obtained for the cooled one.  This difference was
   attributed to the low outcrossing rate obtained within the lower crown
   of the control block.  It was concluded that the observed significant
   selfing in the uncooled block was caused by the first-pollination
   primacy that permitted related pollen to out-compete unrelated pollen in
   the extended pollination season.  A shorter pollination season produced
   a dense pollen cloud of related and unrelated pollen, hence, early
   zygotic selection favoured unrelated embryos.  An extended pollination
   season, on the other hand, permitted related pollen to succeed in
   pollination and fertilization without any challenge by unrelated pollen.
   Controllable variation in the rate of inbreeding reported in this study
   could be useful to improve the genetic quality of seed produced from
   seed orchards and consequently to maximize genetic gains from

@article{Alizoti2010,
	Abstract = {{Until recently, the most important factors affecting the economics and
   genetics of the seed crop from seed orchards were considered to be the
   timing and duration of flowering, variation in fertility and the total
   number of clones used to establish the seed orchards. Change in climatic
   conditions however is an emerging factor that could prove crucial
   regarding the timing of flowering and synchronization among clones and
   thus, the quality and quantity of seed production. The temporal and
   spatial variation in flowering phenology and the duration of flowering
   were studied in consecutive years in a Pinus nigra Arn. seed orchard.
   Sixty plus trees representing the distribution of the species in
   Northern Greece were used to establish the seed orchard, and nineteen
   ramets per clone were planted in a honeycomb experimental design in
   order to avoid kinship. Temporal variation among clones, as well as
   spatial variation among ramets within clones growing at different sites
   of the orchard were recorded, for initiation and duration of male and
   female flowering. The majority of clones were synchronized in dates of
   flowering during the year with weather conditions close to the long-term
   climatic conditions, except for a limited number of clones that were
   precocious or late flowering. The pronounced variability in climatic
   conditions over the 2 years strongly affected the flowering and
   synchronization among clones, resulting in almost complete asynchrony
   during the xerothermic year, which was characterized by a prolonged mean
   monthly temperature increase of 2.3 degrees C and a water deficit of
   53\% in a 7-month-period (November to May). These results suggest that
   one of the effects of a warmer and drier climate may be the lack of
   flowering synchronization, as pollen shedding might be completed before
   female conelets reach the phase of receptivity. The restriction of male
   parentage to a limited number of clones severely violates the panmixia
   assumption and could result in fertilization failure. The projected
   climate change for the Mediterranean region could potentially prove
   detrimental for fertility and flowering synchronization of forest trees,
   having consequences on the quantity and genetic diversity of the seed
   crop in seed orchards, and the natural regeneration of forest trees in
   forest ecosystems due to the reduced percentage of sound seed. (C) 2009

	Abstract = {Many plants benefit from synchronous year-to-year variation in seed production, called masting. Masting benefits plants because it increases the efficiency of pollination and satiates predators, which reduces seed loss. Here, using a 39-year-long dataset, we show that climate warming over recent decades has increased seed production of European beech but decreased the year-to-year variability of seed production and the reproductive synchrony among individuals. Consequently, the benefit that the plants gained from masting has declined. While climate warming was associated with increased reproductive effort, we demonstrate that less effective pollination and greater losses of seeds to predators offset any benefits to the plants. This shows that an apparently simple benefit of climate warming unravels because of complex ecological interactions. Our results indicate that in masting systems, the main beneficiaries of climate-driven increases in seed production are seed predators, not plants.},

	Abstract = {{We developed a novel scoring system to assess spring phenology in a
   northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.) clonal seed orchard. The system was
   used to score from 304 to 364 ramets for three reproductive seasons and
   to place clones into early, intermediate, and late phenology classes.
   Although the absolute number of clones in each phenological class
   changed from year to year, the overall order of clonal flowering was
   highly stable (r(s) = 0.67, p < 0.001). Early-flowering clones flowered
   significantly longer than later flowering clones in all 3 years.
   Dichogamy was present in the orchard, with male flowers of a clone
   emerging from 1.4 to 3.0 d sooner than its female flowers. Mean
   dichogamy values for individual clones ranged from 0.0 to 4.9 (+/- 1.3)
   d. Year strongly influenced a clone's dichogamy value (F = 6.0, p =
   0.004), whereas genotype had no influence. The mean overall phenological
   synchronicity for the 3 years of observations was 0.30 +/- 0.01 or about
   30\% overlap between the time when females were receptive and males were
   shedding pollen. This study represents the first effort to quantify

   provides a snapshot of the current relationship between temperature,

	Abstract = {*Background and Aims Heterodichogamy differs from normal dichogamy, in that it involves two mating types (protogyny and protandry) that occur at a 1 : 1 ratio in a population. Flowering phases of the two mating types are synchronized and reciprocal, which was considered to ensure between-type outcrossing. This study aims to quantify the flowering pattern and pollination efficacy in Juglans mandshurica, a wind-pollinated heterodichogamous tree.*Methods The pattern of flowering phenology was monitored within individual trees and pollen traps were used to measure air-borne pollen loads during the spring in 2003 and 2004. Pollen longevity was determined by staining technique. Also a pollen supplementation experiment was performed in 2004 to assess pollen limitation of fruit production.*Key Results There was no overlap between sexual functions within individual trees. Flowering periods of the two mating types were reciprocal and synchronous in both 2003 and 2004. Air-borne pollen loads were large, and protogynous and protandrous individuals each produced a high pollination peak, consistent with the two blooming periods. Maximum pollen longevity was about 4 h for protandrous individuals, and 3 h for protogynous individuals. Pollen supplementation did not increase fruit production in either protogynous or protandrous individuals.*Conclusions Heterodichogamous flowering in Juglans mandshurica effectively avoids selfing, promotes between-type outcrossing, and leads to efficient pollination in a natural population.},

	Abstract = {Pollination is the primary step in seed formation. Pollination biologists have shown that pollination failure can occur at all steps in the dispersal process and at several different levels. Increased risk of pollination failure is associated with pollen if it is delivered to a stigma too little, too much, too late, too mixed in composition or too poor in quality. It is associated with pollinators when they are too few or too inconstant, and with plants when they are too specialized or too selective. It is associated with populations when they are too sparse, too small in number or too uniform genetically, and with communities when they are too fragmented, genetically impoverished or under rapid modification. Understanding the causes of pollination failure in plants can aid the successful conservation and recovery of rare plants, maintenance of crop yields, and sustainable use of wild plant resources such as forest timber.},

	N2 = {Increasing risk of pollinosis (hay fever) is one of the most anticipated consequences of climate change on human health. Wind-pollinated plants are representative of allergenic species because they include species with the highest capability of causing allergy-related diseases in humans. Therefore, changes in wind-pollinated species may reflect impacts of climate change on allergenic plants. In particular, flowering is one of the developmental stages most affected by climate change. This report specifically addresses changes in flowering dates that have occurred during the three decades 1971?2000 as a function of pollination mode and woodiness. The assessment is made using a phenological data set comprising trends of flowering dates of 29 species in 983 locations in Europe. Linear mixed models assessing the statistical significance of trends while adjusting for spatial correlation are used. The main results indicate for the first time that the onset of flowering of wind-pollinated plants advanced more than for insect-pollinated plants, while full flowering phases tended to advance less. These novel findings are contrary to the results of Fitter and Fitter (2002) for Oxfordshire, who reported larger advances of insect-pollinated plants. Onset of flowering and full flowering of insect-pollinated species are more likely to advance for seasons early in the year; instead, wind-pollinated plants showed no dependence of trends on the season (first flowering) or a decreased advance of phases that are early in the year (full flowering). The effect of woodiness could not be unambiguously defined, but seems to be of minor importance. The presented findings suggest a lengthening of the flowering period in general, which might lead to an increasing time of exposure to airborne pollen of allergic subjects, with consequent likely increment in severity and incidence of allergic symptoms.},

Location Alps (Germany). Methods We studied patterns of species richness and pollination types in 34 alpine grasslands along an altitudinal climatic gradient comparing grazed, mown and non-managed grasslands. Two vegetation assessments were conducted in 2009 on ten 4-m²plots per study site and per survey. Results In total, 484 vascular plant species were recorded. Species richness peaked at intermediate temperatures and was highest in grazed grasslands compared with mown and non-managed grasslands. No significant interaction between management effects and climate was found. Species richness of insect-pollinated plants peaked at lower temperatures (higher altitudes) than species richness of wind-pollinated plant species. The proportion of wind-pollinated plants decreased with decreasing temperature, but the vegetation cover of wind-pollinated plants increased with decreasing temperature. Main conclusions Our results indicate that managing alpine grasslands by extensive grazing maintains high plant diversity over the full subalpine gradient. Rising temperatures with climate change and an upward shift of the diversity peak of plants might result not only in reduced overall diversity because of reduced grassland area at higher altitudes but also in changed species composition and adaptive potential of pollination types.},

Here, we show for 26 long-term data sets from five plant families that the temperature difference between the two previous summers (?T) better predicts seed crops. This discovery explains how masting species tailor their flowering patterns to sites across altitudinal temperature gradients; predicts that masting will be unaffected by increasing mean temperatures under climate change; improves prediction of impacts on seed consumers; demonstrates that strongly masting species are hypersensitive to climate; explains the rarity of consecutive high-seed years without invoking resource constraints; and generates hypotheses about physiological mechanisms in plants and insect seed predators. For plants, ?T has many attributes of an ideal cue. This temperature-difference model clarifies our understanding of mast seeding under environmental change, and could also be applied to other cues, such as rainfall.},

After the second season of perturbation the sexual reproductive investment was higher in the open-top chambers than in the controls and flowering phenology was still accelerated. Leaf phenology and the growth of vegetative tillers followed the same pattern in the open-top chambers as in the controls, but the leaves were longer in the open-top chambers from the end of June until the end of August.

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flower longevity plays an important role in pollen dispersal and reproductive success in plants. In dichogamous plants, the duration of anthesis as well as the time allocated to male and female functions can vary in response to intrinsic factors (e.g., flowering time and resource allocation) and pollination context along a growth season. However, the fitness consequences of phenological dynamics have rarely been examined. This study aims to unravel the potential causes driving variation in flower longevity, duration of sex phases, and phenotypic sex during a flowering season of strongly protandrous Aconitum gymnandrum, and particularly reproductive consequences of the phenological pattern. RESULTS: Population floral sex ratio shifted from completely male at the beginning to completely female at the end of the season, as is common in other protandrous plants. Phenological dynamics of the floral sex ratio and the duration of sex phases caused a shift from femaleness to maleness in the mean phenotypic sex over the whole season. Floral longevity was negatively correlated with flower size and positively affected by temperature. Early flowers within inflorescences rather than early-flowering individuals emphasized the duration of female over male phase. Owing to the dominance of male-phase flowers, early flowering for individual flowers and plants, or female-biased sex resulted in higher pollen deposition per flower and seed set. At the flower level, flower longevity positively affected female reproductive success, while the effect of flower size was negative. By contrast, plant-level female reproductive success was negatively affected by flower longevity but positively correlated to flower size. CONCLUSIONS: The major result of this study lies in elucidating the relationship between variation in phenological sex expression and floral longevity and their fitness consequences of protandrous A. gymnandrum. The contrasting results on female fitness for individual flowers and plants contribute to our current understanding of the adaptive significance of floral longevity.},

	Abstract = {Cones are harvested from Mediterranean Stone pine Pinus pinea L. for their edible kernels, pine nuts, which have been used as a food item in the region since Palaeolithic times. At present, cone yields render higher incomes to the owners of these pine forests than any other forest product. The large annual variation of cone yields is an important issue for forest management planning, which requires further research in order to establish its causes. One of the simplest explanations given for masting habits in polycarpic plants is that of weather tracking. Many plant ecologists, however, consider that this theory is insufficient and that further causes should be investigated. In this context, the present study analyses historical weather and yield registers over 41 years in one of the world's main Stone pine areas, the Northern Inland Plateau of Spain. Significant relationships found between rainfall and temperatures at certain key periods during the 4-year cone development period allowed for a multiple linear regression model for the log-transformed annual cone yield to be set up. This also included a negative autocorrelation with the ripening cone load during strobili induction. The model accounts for 75{\%} of total variance between years. The observed trend of cone-yield reduction from 180 to less than 100kgha−1 in the last 40 years was slightly overestimated by the predicted effects of the covariables that show significant tendencies to a warmer and drier climate.},

	Abstract = {The rich literature that characterizes the field of pollination biology has focused largely on animal-pollinated plants. At least 10 {\%} of angiosperms are wind pollinated, and this mode of pollination has evolved on multiple occasions among unrelated lineages, and hence this discrepancy in research interest is surprising. Here, the evolution and functional ecology of pollination and mating in wind-pollinated plants are discussed, a theoretical framework for modelling the selection of wind pollination is outlined, and pollen capture and the occurrence of pollen limitation in diverse wind-pollinated herbs are investigated experimentally.Wind pollination may commonly evolve to provide reproductive assurance when pollinators are scarce. Evidence is presented that pollen limitation in wind-pollinated plants may not be as common as it is in animal-pollinated species. The studies of pollen capture in wind-pollinated herbs demonstrate that pollen transfer efficiency is not substantially lower than in animal-pollinated plants as is often assumed. These findings challenge the explanation that the evolution of few ovules in wind-pollinated flowers is associated with low pollen loads. Floral and inflorescence architecture is crucial to pollination and mating because of the aerodynamics of wind pollination. Evidence is provided for the importance of plant height, floral position, and stamen and stigma characteristics in promoting effective pollen dispersal and capture. Finally, it is proposed that geitonogamous selfing may alleviate pollen limitation in many wind-pollinated plants with unisexual flowers.},

Phenological observations indicated significant differences between the species for almost all vegetative and reproductive characters examined; however, a large amount of overlap was also observed. Pollination experiments indicated that pollen limitation is not a significant factor in reducing fruit set in these anemophilous species. Pollen-ovule ratios ranged from 1 to 25 ? 106. Pollen was 80?90{\%} viable at time of shedding. The large surface area of vegetative structures (e.g., leaves) at the time of pollination may retard the flow of pollen into and out of the canopy and thus increase self-pollination. A full diallel cross, replicated 5 times, was made among 8 trees (4 trees of each species) to characterize combining ability and compatibility relationships. All trees were found to be both geitonogamous and xenogamous to varying degrees. A high frequency of putative interploidal cross-compatibility was also observed. Fruits from these interspecific crosses were found to be germinable. Observations on individual trees suggested that dichogamy may help to reduce selfing and promote outcrossing in this breeding system. While most trees exhibited a temporal separation of genders, the trait was found to be quite plastic (i.e., trees switched between protogyny and protandry between years). Pistillate flowers were receptive for all trees within a species during the same general time period; however, pollen shedding varied considerably among trees and between years. Both species appear to be utilizing a broad array of mechanisms in order to maintain reproductive fidelity and adequate fruit set.},

	N2 = {Abstract Dioecious plants may be pollinated biotically by animals or abiotically via wind or water currents. It has been hypothesized that these two types of pollen vectors might impose contrasting selective pressures on plant flowering phenology. In the present study we describe the flowering phenology of two sympatric dioecious species with contrasting pollination modes: Mercurialis perennis (wind-pollinated) and Tamus communis (insect-pollinated). We estimated selection differentials and gradients for flowering time and flowering synchrony. As flowering time might depend on the accumulation of enough internal resources, we also estimated direct and indirect selection on plant size. Both species have male-biased sexual ratios, and males are bigger and produce larger flower displays than females, but only in T. communis do males bloom earlier and for longer than females. Selection gradients suggest that selection tends to favor early-flowering females of T. communis. There is no evidence of direct current selection on the flowering phenology of M. perennis. Intersexual differences in phenology fit with sex allocation and sexual selection theories. As we hypothesized, phenology of the animal-pollinated species is under stronger selection than that of the wind-pollinated species and we discuss the potential role of pollen vectors in shaping the flowering phenologies of the study species.},

	Abstract = {{Numerous abiotic factors have an important impact on the phenology of
   woody plants with temperature as the main driver of their development.
   Furthermore, the biological factors connected with phenotypic plasticity
   and genetic heterogeneity might be the cause of differentiation in
   phenological response to abiotic factors. As objects of our study, we
   chose black alder and silver birch trees. The main aims of the study
   were to demonstrate the spatial and temporal diversity in the timing of
   Alnus glutinosa and Betula pendula pollination as well as to identify
   factors affecting these variations. We focused on abiotic factors such
   as thermal conditions: air and surface temperatures, within and between
   population variability. Phenological observations were carried out in
   Rzeszow (SE Poland) in a period of four years at over a dozen locations.
   Stands differed in their thermal conditions and prevalent land use
   types. The pollination pattern in the study area was presented against
   the background of local thermal conditions which were described by Land
   Surface Temperature (LST) and maximum daily air temperature. LST was
   estimated with a single-channel algorithm using satellite images
   obtained from Landsat 7 and 8. Our results showed great spatial and
   temporal diversity in the pollination pattern in the study area.
   Year-to-year variations in the B. pendula pollination pattern were less
   pronounced than in the case of A. glutinosa. The pollination pattern was
   strongly influenced by temperature before and during pollination. In the
   study area, the variability of LST was greater than that of air
   temperature but the relationships between the timing of pollination
   phenophases and LST or land use types were weak. It was observed that
   the same sites were similar in their pollination pattern - the timing of
   phenophases was `accelerated' or `delayed' during the whole study
   period. The same individuals were the first or the last that began to
   pollinate independently of the year. We concluded that despite the
   impact of temperature on A. glutinosa and B. pendula development, the
   phenotype of an individual tree might be as important for phenological
   variability as local climate.}},
